              Teachers can add their own classes to a class list, along with the class times and comments on the class,
              add students to those classes along with various comments, add and edit lesson across the curriculum and add those lessons to timeslots of classes.
              These lessons then show up in teachers own schedule and are able to be exported to an excel file.
              Although there is no direct communication function, teachers are able to share classes to other teachers who will support in the teaching of those classes,
              and through comments on activities and other areas teachers are able to share ideas about lessons.

              Family Photo Album is a Python Flask application inspired by the current COVID situation to help share photos with family and friends easily. As I am living in
              China and most of my family live in England this was something that I would like to be easier than sharing small groups of photos on social media (especially in China)
              or directly through different chatting apps. The app is built in Flask and templated with Jinja. The image files are stored on the file system of the server and accessed
              through the SQLite database.

              Users can create albums and upload photos to the albums, with some small editing abilities for the photos (mainly just the ability
              to rotate the images to make sure they are in the intended aspect). These albums can then be shared with other users directly by sharing to a username, or shared through
              the created links to both users or non-users. Individual photos can be shared to other users.

            <h2 class="content-tagline">Background & Current Situation</h2>
            <p>I am originally from England and I currently live in Beijing China. I have been in China for the last 8 years working as an English teacher. I have picked up a fair amount of Chinese, my family is here and I am looking to make a permanent
                switch to a full-time web development position.</p>
            <h2 class="content-tagline">I'm learning all the time</h2>
            <p>Throughout the last few years I have used my free time to study. I have spent time studying Harvard's <a class="modal-caller">CS50 course</a>, The Odin Project, the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as some time on Angular Python
                Ruby and C#. While there have been (perhaps) wide-ranging subjects, they have all helped me to develop a certain kind of thinking that has improved my problem solving and problem identification skills. As I come across more problems I
                find new and better ways to solve them.
            </p>
            <p>I am always finding new things to improve on and learn more about. I am still learning a lot about Angular (as well as looking more into React and Vue), and also learning about the shadow DOM and different ways to do things without using a
                framework or so many libraries - this page for example uses HTML CSS and JS utilising web components. I am always trying to bolster my knowledge about web foundations such as HTTP, DNS, TCP/IP.</p>
            <h2 class="content-tagline">Looking forward</h2>
            <p>I'm looking for opportunities where I can show what I have learned, and have a chance to learn and develop a lot more.</p>
